Behavior 1:

The EVC has a stored level >= 2

Behavior 2:

The EVC has a stored level >= 2, but the RBC is initially unavailable (2 retries) 

Behavior 3:

The EVC has a stored level < 2

Behavior 4:

The EVC has a stored level >= 2, the sensor does not work, but the driver continues the use-case (fail-stop behavior for the sensor)

Behavior 5:

The EVC has a stored level >= 2, the sensor does work, but the connection with the RBC is lost when the RBC routine is started (fail-stop behavior for the RBC)

Behavior 6:

The EVC has a stored level >= 2, the sensor does not work, and the connection with the RBC is lost when the RBC routine is started (fail-stop behavior for both the RBC and the sensor)

Behavior 7:

The EVC has a stored level >= 2, but the RBC is corrupted in all the interested phases, namely phases:

- Contacting the RBC

- Performing the RBC routine

- Select the Mode

- Start procedure

(byzantine behavior for the RBC)

Behavior 8:

The EVC is corrupted in all the interested phases, namely phases:

- Inserting the Driver ID

- Validating the level

- Contacting the RBC

- Performing the RBC routine

- Select the Mode

- Start procedure

- Acknowledgement

(byzantine behavior for the EVC)

Behavior 9:

The EVC has a level >= 2, but the RBC is corrupted in the phase:

- Performing the RBC routine

(byzantine behavior for the RBC)

Behavior 10:

The EVC has a level >= 2, but it is corrupted in phases:

- Start procedure

- Acknowledgement

Also, the RBC is corrupted in the phase:

- Performing the RBC routine

(byzantine behavior for both the EVC and the RBC)
